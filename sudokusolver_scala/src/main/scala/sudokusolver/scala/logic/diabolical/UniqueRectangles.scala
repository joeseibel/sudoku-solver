 * https://www.sudokuwiki.org/Unique_Rectangles
 *
 * The Unique Rectangles solution works by identifying the potential for an invalid pattern of candidates called the
 * Deadly Pattern and then removing candidates that if set as the value would lead to the Deadly Pattern. A Deadly
 * Pattern is defined as a group of four unsolved cells arranged to form a rectangle, each cell containing the same two
 * candidates and only those candidates, and the cells being located in two rows, two columns, and two blocks. If a
 * board contains the Deadly Pattern, then the board cannot have a single solution, but would have multiple solutions.
 * The advantage of recognizing this pattern comes when a board contains a pattern which is close to the Deadly Pattern
 * and the removal of certain candidates would lead to the Deadly Pattern. If a valid board contains a pattern which is
 * close to the Deadly Pattern, it is known that the board will never enter into the Deadly Pattern and candidates can
 * be removed if setting those candidates as values would lead to the Deadly Pattern. A rectangle can be further
 * described by identifying its floor cells and its roof cells. A rectangle's floor are the cells that only contain the
 * two common candidates. A rectangle's roof are the cells that contain the two common candidates as well as additional
 * candidates.
 *
 * Type 1
 *
 * If a rectangle has one roof cell, then this is a potential Deadly Pattern. If the additional candidates were to be
 * removed from the roof, then that would lead to a Deadly Pattern. The two common candidates can be removed from the
 * roof leaving only the additional candidates remaining.

/*
 * Type 2
 *
 * If a rectangle has two roof cells and there is only one additional candidate appearing in both roof cells, then this
 * is a potential Deadly Pattern. If the additional candidate were to be removed from the roof cells, then that would
 * lead to a Deadly Pattern, therefore the additional candidate must be the solution for one of the two roof cells. The
 * common candidate can be removed from any other cell that can see both of the roof cells.

/*
 * Type 3
 *
 * If a rectangle has two roof cells, each roof cell has one additional candidate, and the additional candidates are

 * so the roof cells can be treated as a single cell with the two additional candidates. If there is another cell that
 * can see both roof cells and has the additional candidates as its candidates, then the roof cells and the other cell
 * effectively form a Naked Pair. The additional candidates can be removed from any other cell in the unit.
