 * https://www.sudokuwiki.org/Grouped_X_Cycles
 *
 * Grouped X-Cycles are an extension of X-Cycles in which a vertex can be a cell or a group of cells. Just like
 * X-Cycles, a Grouped X-Cycles graph is for a single candidate. A group is a set of cells with the candidate which
 * share two units. This means that a group exists in the same block and the same row, or it exists in the same block
 * and the same column.
 *
 * Similar to X-Cycles, the edges of a Grouped X-Cycles graph are either strong or weak. Unlike X-Cycles, the edges can
 * connect two cells, a cell and a group, or two groups. A strong link connects two vertices in a unit when they are the
 * only non-overlapping vertices in that unit. A weak link connects two vertices in a unit when they are not the only
 * non-overlapping vertices in that unit.
 *
 * Since a vertex can be a cell or a group of cells, it is possible for vertices to overlap and even for edges to
 * overlap. For example, consider a unit which has three cells with a candidate, two of which form a group and one which
 * is outside the group. In this case there would be four vertices: three vertices for the cells and one for the group.
 * Two of the cell vertices overlap with the cells of the group. This example would also have one strong link and three
 * weak links. The strong link would connect the group to the cell outside the group. This is a strong link because when
 * we discount the cells that overlap with the group, there are only two vertices in the unit. The weak links connect
 * all the individual cells. They are weak because there are more than two cell vertices in the unit when we discount
 * the group.
 *
 * A Grouped X-Cycle is a cycle in the graph in which the edges alternate between strong and weak links. If one vertex
 * of a link contains the solution, then the other vertex must not contain the solution. If one cell of a strong link
 * does not contain the solution, then the other vertex must contain the solution. If a vertex is a group, containing
 * the solution means that one of the cells of the group is the solution. If a vertex is a cell, containing the solution
 * means that the cell is the solution.
 *
 * Note that this implementation of Grouped X-Cycles can handle cases in which the chain is not strictly alternating
 * between strong and weak links. It is tolerant of cases in which a strong link takes the place of a weak link.
 *
 * Rule 1:
 *
 * If a Grouped X-Cycle has an even number of vertices and therefore continuously alternates between strong and weak,
 * then the graph is perfect and has no flaws. Each of the weak links can be treated as a strong link. The candidate can
 * be removed from any cell which is in the same unit as both vertices of a weak link, but not contained in either of
 * the vertices.
